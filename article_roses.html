				<p>june 2021</p>

				<p>being lucky enough to arrive in season with all the roses in bloom, this june i got to expirance the beauty of Columbus Ohio's <a href="https://parkofroses.org/" target="_blank">park of roses</a>. i had visted before at my brother wedding but i hadnt yet fostered an interest in photography. After purchasing my camera and a macro filter, i decided i had to visit again!</p>
				
				<p>the weather was wonderful with lighting perfectly catered towards the capturing of the viberant colors on display that day. Many of the photos i took using my macro filter, which allowed me to capture the invisible details and delicate folds of the flowers: such as you can see in this picture</p>

				<p>the varity of colors: greens, blues, purples, reds made it difficult to choose just a few photos for this article! However ive chosen this image because of how beautiful it is despite what may be considered by some defects.</p>

				<p>that macro filer again exposing extraordinary detail! Took me 10 minutes to get the shallow focus dialed perfectly in on the little dude's head</p>
