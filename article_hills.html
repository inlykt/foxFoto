				<p>june 2021</p>

				<p>back in june i spent a full day hiking at <a href="https://www.hockinghills.com/" target="_blank">hocking hills national park</a>, one of many beautiful locations in central ohio. While i regularing enjoy the many parks near my home, i dont often travel so far: from where i live, about two hours. This time, however, it was well worth it!</p>
					
				<p>the weather was beautful, not too hot, yet sunny enough for great photos. And i really did spend all day there, nearly 5 hours of hiking, photographing, discovering. The trails were not at all crowded, despite the wonderful weather, and i even got to meet a few cool pups blazing trails with their people.</p>

				<p>the photo you see here was is of ceder falls, a gorgeous waterfall which slides its way into a crystal clear pool</p>

				<p>this was rose lake, a peaceful break from from the forest where the sky, treeline, and water all meet as one in the distance</p>

				<p>altogether, it was a wonderful time! Hard work, but well worth it. Nothing like nature to give you time to think and simply bw. I highly recommend anyone in the area check it out, even if its a bit of a drive, you wont regret it. i know it wont be long before i can no longer resist visiting again</p>
