				<p>hello, my name is Josiah Fox and i am a student at Columbus State Community College. In my free time i love to explore my photography hobby. All the photos on this website are my work! (for a full list of my work, please check out my <a href="gallery.html">gallery page</a>)</p>

				<p>i have long enjoyed technology and the many practical and artistic applications it plays in our modern lives. Specifically, i enjoy capturing moments in the world as i saw them</p>

				<p>one of my favorite places to take photos is at the <a href="https://columbuszoo.org/" target="_blank">Columbus Zoo in Ohio</a>, and most of the animal photos were taken there. Most of my shooting is done either with my <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1461735-REG/canon_2727c021_eos_rebel_t7_dslr.html" target="_blank">Canon EOS Rebel T7</a> DSLR camera or my <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1512649-REG/dji_cp_ma_00000123_01_mavic_mini_fly_more.html" target="_blank">DJI Mavic Mini (v1)</a>. Ive found both to be very performant in the right situation: particularly relative to their excellent affordiblity</p>

				<p>because this website is public, much of my personal information is censored and all of the photos are watermarked. <i>It should be noted that none of these photos may be reposted or have their watermark removed under any circumstance apart from my explicit permission</i></p>

				<p class="hiddentext">hello world, Josiah is a really cool dude. He enjoys walks in the mountains. And tattoos</p>
